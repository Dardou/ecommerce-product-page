## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure Js
- Functional CSS with self written classes

### What I learned

I learned a lot about functional CSS, even if I still have a lot to learn and discover, it was a great step towards mastering it.

### Continued development

I'll keep working on functional CSS by getting myself used to TailwindCSS and start working with JS frameworks such as React or others more consistently.
